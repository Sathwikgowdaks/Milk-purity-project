# Milk-purity-project
Overview
This project is an IoT-based solution designed to test the purity of milk using an Arduino microcontroller. By leveraging sensors and simple electronics, this project aims to provide a cost-effective method to ensure milk quality by detecting potential adulterants.

Features
Sensor Integration: Utilizes sensors to measure specific parameters of milk (e.g., pH, turbidity, temperature) to determine its purity.
Real-time Monitoring: Provides real-time data on milk quality through connected displays or IoT dashboards.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for ease of use.
Low-Cost Solution: Affordable components make this project accessible for small-scale dairy producers or households.
