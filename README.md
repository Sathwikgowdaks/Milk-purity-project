# Milk Purity Test Using Arduino

## Overview

This project is an IoT-based solution designed to test the purity of milk using an Arduino microcontroller. By leveraging sensors and simple electronics, this project aims to provide a cost-effective method to ensure milk quality by detecting potential adulterants.

## Features

- **Sensor Integration**: Utilizes sensors to measure specific parameters of milk (e.g., pH, turbidity, temperature) to determine its purity.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides real-time data on milk quality through connected displays or IoT dashboards.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for ease of use.
- **Low-Cost Solution**: Affordable components make this project accessible for small-scale dairy producers or households.

## Components

- Arduino Uno (or any compatible microcontroller)
- pH sensor
- Turbidity sensor
- Temperature sensor
- OLED/LCD display (optional)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
